# Conditons
Automated Conditions Foundry VTT
This module requires Combat Utility Belt for basic fuctionality 
It will automaticly set speed and vision on the actor token based on the CUB effects present on the actor.
These effects work well alongside About-Time and Dynamic Effects for auto-application. 

Upon aplication of the CUB conditions for: Blinded, Stunned, Petrified, Grappled, Restrained, Unconsious, Incapacitiated, Exhaustion 1-5; the revlavent adjustments will be made to the actor/token data. Vision will be dissabled on Blinded tokens, and speed reduced on the others. 
These changes are non-permenant and will revert upon removal of the status effect.
